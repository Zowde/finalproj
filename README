## Project Description

This is a Modular Multithreaded String Analyzer Pipeline implemented in C for an Operating Systems course at Reichman University.

## Overview

A plugin-based system that processes input lines from STDIN through a chain of transformation plugins. Each plugin runs in its own thread and communicates with the next plugin via thread-safe bounded queues.

## Features

- Dynamic plugin loading (.so files)
- Multithreaded architecture with proper synchronization
- Thread-safe producer-consumer queues
- 6 built-in plugins: logger, uppercaser, rotator, flipper, expander, typewriter
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Support for repeated plugin usage

## Building
```bash
./build.sh
```

## Running
```bash
echo "hello world" | ./output/analyzer 20 uppercaser rotator logger
```

## Testing
```bash
./test.sh
```
